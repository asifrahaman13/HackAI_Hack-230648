## How to set up the environement.

Firt clone the repository:

```
git init
git clone https://github.com/asifrahaman13/poetry.git
```

Next go into the techfest_hackathon folder.

```
cd backend/
```

If you want to keep the virtual environment in the same folder structure locally then run the following command:

```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Activate the virtual environment.

```
poetry shell
```

Next you need to create a .env file to store the environmen variables. In unix based system you can use the following command:

```
touch .env
```

Next add the environment variables.

```
RAPIDAPI_ENDPOINT=<your rapid api endpoint>
RAPIDAPI_API_KEY=<your rapid api api key>
```

Activate the environment variable. 

```
source .env
```

Install the dependencies and packages.

```
poetry install
```

Next you need to set up the environment for the front end.

```
cd frontend/
yarn install 
yarn start
```

## How to run the backend code

You need to run the fast api in a port say 5000.

```
poetry run uvicorn src.index:app --reload --port=5000
```

You can run the code from the terminal itself using the following commands:

```
poetry run python3 src/main.py
```

The uagents library will run on port 8000.
